Creating and plotting distributions
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Probability distributions within ``reliability`` are Python objects, which allows us to specify just the type of distribution and parameters. Once the distribution object is created, we can access a large number of methods, some of which will require additional input. There are 6 different probability distributions available in ``reliability``. These are:

-   Weibull Distribution (α, β, γ)
-   Exponential Distribution (λ, γ)
-   Gamma Distribution (α, β, γ)
-   Normal Distribution (μ, σ)
-   Lognormal Distribution (μ, σ)
-   Beta Distribution (α, β)

In all of the distributions which use γ, the γ parameter is used to location shift the distribution to the right. The Beta distribution is only defined in the range {0,1}.

Understanding how to create and plot distributions is easiest with an example. The following code will create a Lognormal Distribution with parameters mu=5 and sigma=1. From this distribution, we will use the plot() method which provides a quick way to visualise the five functions and also provides a summary of the descriptive statistics.

.. code:: python

    from reliability.Distributions import Lognormal_Distribution
    dist = Lognormal_Distribution(mu=5,sigma=1)
    dist.plot()

The following methods are available for all distributions:

-   parameter names - varies by distribution. Eg. dist.mu will provide the mu parameter in the above example.
-   parameters - returns an array of parameters. These are in alphabetical order, so for Lognormal it would be [mu,sigma].
-   mean
-   variance
-   standard_deviation
-   skewness
-   kurtosis
-   excess_kurtosis
-   median
-   mode
-   plot() - plots all functions (PDF, CDF, SF, HF, CHF). No additional arguments are accepted.
-   PDF() - plots the probability density function. Plotting keywords (such as xlabel, title, color) are accepted and used. If not specified they are preset.
-   CDF() - plots the cumulative distribution function.  Plotting keywords (such as xlabel, title, color) are accepted and used. If not specified they are preset.
-   SF() - plots the survival function (also known as reliability function).  Plotting keywords (such as xlabel, title, color) are accepted and used. If not specified they are preset.
-   HF() - plots the hazard function.  Plotting keywords (such as xlabel, title, color) are accepted and used. If not specified they are preset.
-   CHF() - plots the cumulative hazard function.  Plotting keywords (such as xlabel, title, color) are accepted and used. If not specified they are preset.
-   quantile() - Calculates the quantile (time until a fraction has failed) for a given fraction failing. Also known as 'b' life where b5 is the time at which 5% have failed. Eg. dist.quantile(0.05) will give the b5 life.
-   AICc() - Akaike Information Criterion - This is a goodness of fit measure that is used by Fitters.Fit_Everything to compare goodness of fit. Input requires a list of the x-values for which to calculate the AICc.
-   BIC() - Bayesian Information Criterion - This is a goodness of fit measure that is used by Fitters.Fit_Everything to compare goodness of fit. Input requires a list of the x-values for which to calculate the BIC.
-   mean_residual_life() - Average residual lifetime of an item given that the item has survived up to a given time. Effectively the mean of the remaining amount (right side) of a distribution at a given time. You must specify the x-value at which to calculate MRL. Eg. dist.MRL(10)
-   stats() - prints all the descriptive statistics. Same as the statistics shown using .plot() but printed to console.
-   random_samples() - draws random samples from the distribution to which it is applied. Same as rvs in scipy.stats. You must specify the number of samples. Eg. data = dist.random_samples(100) will set data as a list of 100 random samples from the distribution.

Note that .plot() does not require plt.show() to be used as it will automatically show, however the other 5 plotting functions will not be displayed until plt.show() is used. This is to allow the user to overlay multiple plots on the figure or change titles, labels, and legends as required.
Further detail about all of the functions is available using the help function within Python. Simply type:

.. code:: python

    from reliability.Distributions import Lognormal_Distribution
    print(help(Lognormal_Distribution))
