Creating and plotting distributions
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Probability distributions within ``reliability`` are Python objects, which allows us to specify just the type of distribution and parameters, and from that we can access a large number of attributes and other methods. There are 6 different probability distributions available in ``reliability``. These are:

-   Weibull Distribution
-   Exponential Distribution
-   Gamma Distribution
-   Normal Distribution
-   Lognormal Distribution
-   Beta Distribution

Understanding how to create and plot distributions is easiest with an example. The following code will create a Lognormal Distribution with parameters mu=5 and sigma=1. From this distribution, we will use the plot() method which provides a quick way to visualise the five functions and also provides a summary of the descriptive statistics.

.. code:: python

    from reliability.Distributions import Lognormal_Distribution
    dist = Lognormal_Distribution(mu=5,sigma=1)
    dist.plot()
