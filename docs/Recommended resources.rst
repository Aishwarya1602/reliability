Recommended resources
'''''''''''''''''''''

The following collection of resources are things I have found useful during my reliability engineering studies and also while writing ``reliability``. There are many other resources available (especially textbooks), so I encourage you to do your own research. If you find something you think is worth adding here, please send me an email.

**Textbooks**

-    Reliability Engineering and Risk Analysis: A practical Guide, Third Edition (2017), by M. Modarres, M. Kaminskiy, and V. Krivtsov.
-    `Probability Distributions Used in Reliability Engineering (2011), by A. O'Conner, M. Modarres, and A. Mosleh. <http://crr.umd.edu/sites/default/files/FreeBooks/Probability%20Distributions%20Used%20in%20Reliability%20Engineering%20r1.pdf>`_
-    Practical Reliability Engineering, by P. O'Conner and A. Kleyner.

**Free software**

-    `Lifelines <https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/lifelines/blob/master/README.md>`_ - a Python library for survival analysis.
-    `Parameter Solver v3.0 <https://biostatistics.mdanderson.org/SoftwareDownload/SingleSoftware/Index/6>`_ - a biostatistics tool for quickly making some simple calculations with probability distributions.
-    `Orange <https://orange.biolab.si/>`_ - a standalone data mining and data visualization program that runs using Python. Beautifully interactive data analysis workflows with a large toolbox. Not much reliability related content but good for preprocessing.
-    `R Studio - Survival analysis library <https://r-posts.com/steps-to-perform-survival-analysis-in-r/>`_ - one of the more popular survival analysis libraries available in the open source commmunity.

**Paid software**

-    Minitab
-    Reliasoft
-    SAS JMP

**Websites for Reliability**

-    `Reliawiki <http://reliawiki.org/index.php/Life_Data_Analysis_Reference_Book>`_ - an excellent reference written by Reliasoft that is intended largely as a guide to reliability engineering when using Reliasoft's software but is equally as good to understand concepts without using their software.
-    `Reliability Analytics Toolkit <https://reliabilityanalyticstoolkit.appspot.com/>`_ - a collection of tools which run using the Google App Engine.
-    `Univariate distributions relationships <http://www.math.wm.edu/~leemis/chart/UDR/UDR.html>`_ - an excellent resource for understanding more about probability distributions and how they are related. Some strange parametrisations are used in the documentation.
-    `Kijima G-renewal process <http://www.soft4structures.com/WeibullGRP/JSPageGRP.jsp>`_ - an online calculator for simulating the G-renewal process
-    `Prediction of future recurrent events <http://www.soft4structures.com/WeibullGRP/JSPageGRPinverse_1.jsp>`_ - an online calculator for predicting future recurrent events with different underlying probability functions.
-    `Maintenance optimization <http://www.soft4structures.com/WeibullGRP/JSPageMTN.jsp>`_ - an online calculator for optimal replacement policy (time) under Kijima imperfect repair model.

**Websites for Mathematics**

-    `Wolfram Alpha <https://www.wolframalpha.com/>`_ - an amazing computational knowledge engine. Great for checking your calculations.
-    `Derivative calculator <https://www.derivative-calculator.net/>`_ - calculates derivatives. Slightly more user friendly input method than Wolfram alpha and doesn't time out as easily for big calculations.
-    `Integral calculator <https://www.integral-calculator.com/>`_ - calculates integrals. Slightly more user friendly input method than Wolfram alpha and doesn't time out as easily for big calculations.

**Getting free access to academic papers**

-    `arXiv <arXiv.org>`_ - a database run by Cornell university that provides open access to over 1 million academic papers that have been submitted. If you can't find it here then check on Sci-Hub.
-    `Sci-Hub <https://sci-hub.tw/>`_ - paste in a DOI to get a copy of the academic paper. Academic knowledge should be free and this site makes it possible.
