Recommended resources
'''''''''''''''''''''

The following collection of resources are things I have found useful during my reliability engineering studies and also while writing ``reliability``. There are many other resources available (especially textbooks), so I encourage you to do your own research. If you find something you think is worth adding here, please send me an email.
