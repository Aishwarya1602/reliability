Fitting a model to ALT data
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''

.. note:: This document and the associated functions are a work in progress. This notice will be removed when the models are available in the PyPI release of reliability.

Before reading this section, you should be familiar with `ALT probability plots <https://reliability.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ALT%20probability%20plots.html>`_, and `Fitting distributions <https://reliability.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Fitting%20a%20specific%20distribution%20to%20data.html>`_ to non-ALT datasets.

The module ``reliability.ALT`` contains fitting function for 15 different ALT life-stress models. Each model is a combination of the life model with the scale or location parameter replaced with a life-stress model. For example, the Weibull-Exponential model is found by replacing the :math:`\alpha` parameter with the equation for the exponential life-stress model as follows:

:math:`\text{Weibull PDF:} \hspace{40mm} f(t) = \frac{\beta t^{ \beta - 1}}{ \alpha^ \beta} .exp \left(-(\frac{t}{\alpha })^ \beta \right)`

:math:`\text{Exponential Life-Stress model:} \hspace{5mm} L(T) = b.exp\left(\frac{a}{T} \right)`

Replacing :math:`\alpha` with :math:`L(T)` gives the PDF of the Weibull-Exponential model:

:math:`\text{Weibull-Exponential:} \hspace{25mm} f(t,T) = \frac{\beta t^{ \beta - 1}}{ \left(b.exp\left(\frac{a}{T} \right) \right)^ \beta} .exp \left(-\left(\frac{t}{\left(b.exp\left(\frac{a}{T} \right) \right) }\right)^ \beta \right)` 

The correct substitutions for each type of model are:

:math:`\text{Weibull:} \hspace{12mm} \alpha = L(T)`

:math:`\text{Normal:} \hspace{12mm} \mu = L(T)`

:math:`\text{Lognormal:} \hspace{5mm} \mu = ln \left( L(T) \right)`

The `life models <https://reliability.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Equations%20of%20supported%20distributions.html>`_ available are:

- Weibull_2P
- Normal_2P
- Lognormal_2P

The life-stress models available are:

:math:`\text{Exponential (also used for Arrhenius equation):} \hspace{29mm} L(T)=b.exp \left(\frac{a}{T} \right)`

:math:`\text{Eyring:} \hspace{108mm} L(T)= \frac{1}{T} .exp \left( - \left( c - \frac{a}{T} \right) \right)`

:math:`\text{Power (also known as inverse power):} \hspace{48mm} L(S)=a .S^n`

:math:`\text{Dual-Exponential (also known as Temperature-Humidity):} \hspace{7mm} L(T,H)=c.exp \left(\frac{a}{T} + \frac{b}{H} \right)`

:math:`\text{Power-Exponential (also known as Thermal-Non-Thermal):} \hspace{4mm} L(T,S)=c.S^n.exp \left(\frac{a}{T} \right)`

When choosing a model, it is important to consider the physics involved in the life-stress model rather than just trying everything to see what fits best. For example, the Power-Exponential model is most appropriate for a dataset that was obtained from an ALT reliability test with a thermal and a non-thermal stress (such as temperature and voltage). It would be inappropriate to model the data from a Temperature-Humidity test using a Power-Exponential model as the physics suggests that a Temperature-Humidity test should be modelled using the Dual-Exponential model.

Each of the fitting functions works in a very similar way so the documentation below can be applied to all of the models with minor modifications to the parameter names of the outputs. The following documentation is for the Weibull-Power model.

Inputs:

-   failures - an array or list of the failure times.
-   failure_stress - an array or list of the corresponding stresses (such as temperature) at which each failure occurred. This must match the length of failures as each failure is tied to a failure stress.
-   right_censored - an array or list of all the right censored failure times
-   right_censored_stress - an array or list of the corresponding stresses (such as temperature) at which each right_censored data point was obtained. This must match the length of right_censored as each right_censored value is tied to a right_censored stress.
-   use_level_stress - The use level stress at which you want to know the mean life. Optional input.
-   print_results - True/False. Default is True
-   show_plot - True/False. Default is True
-   CI - confidence interval for estimating confidence limits on parameters. Must be between 0 and 1. Default is 0.95 for 95% CI.
-   initial_guess - starting values for [a,n]. Default is [500000,-1.5]. Optional input. If fitting fails, you will be prompted to try a better initial guess and you can use this input to do it.

Outputs:

-   a - fitted parameter from the Power model
-   n - fitted parameter from the Power model
-   beta - the fitted Weibull_2P beta
-   loglik2 - LogLikelihood*-2
-   AICc - Akaike Information Criterion
-   BIC - Bayesian Information Criterion
-   a_SE - the standard error (sqrt(variance)) of the parameter
-   n_SE - the standard error (sqrt(variance)) of the parameter
-   beta_SE - the standard error (sqrt(variance)) of the parameter
-   a_upper - the upper CI estimate of the parameter
-   a_lower - the lower CI estimate of the parameter
-   n_upper - the upper CI estimate of the parameter
-   n_lower - the lower CI estimate of the parameter
-   beta_upper - the upper CI estimate of the parameter
-   beta_lower - the lower CI estimate of the parameter
-   results - a dataframe of the results (point estimate, standard error, Lower CI and Upper CI for each parameter)
-   mean_life - the mean life at the use_level_stress. Only calculated if use_level_stress is specified

In the following example, we will fit the Weibull-Power model to an ALT dataset obtained from a fatigue test. This dataset can be found in ``reliability.Datasets``. We want to know the mean life at the use level of 60 so the parameter use_level_stress is specified. All other values are left as defaults and the results and plot are shown.
