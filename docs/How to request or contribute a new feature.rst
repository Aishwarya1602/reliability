How to request or contribute a new feature
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Please raise an `issue <https://github.com/MatthewReid854/reliability/issues/>`_ on GitHub for any errors, or requested features. From there, we can put together a plan on how to proceed. If you are requesting something, please include as much detail as possible, such as:

-   a detailed explaination of what the new feature is and why you think it would be useful
-   example Python code
-   any references such as academic papers or textbooks which describe the necessary steps
-   screenshots from other programs (such as Minitab, JMP Pro, Reliasoft) which show the feature in use

Remember to upgrade ``reliability`` to the newest version and double check that the requested feature is not in there, as the codebase is constantly evolving.
