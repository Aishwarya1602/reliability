Similar Distributions
'''''''''''''''''''''

The function similar_distributions is a tool for finding the probability distributions that are most similar to an input distribution.
It uses Monte Carlo sampling of an input distribution object to determine the best fitting and therefore most similar distributions.

Inputs

-   distribution - a distribution object created using the reliability.Distributions module
-   include_location_shifted - True/False. Default is True. When set to True it will include Weibull_3P, Lognormal_3P, Gamma_3P, Expon_2P
-   show_plot - True/False. Default is True
-   print_results - True/False. Default is True
-   monte_carlo_trials - the number of monte carlo trials to use in the calculation. Default is 1000. Using over 10000 will be very slow. Using less than 100 will be inaccurate and will be automatically reset to 100.
-   number_of_distributions_to_show - the number of similar distributions to show. Default is 3. If the number specified exceeds the number available (typically 8), then the number specified will automatically be reduced.

Outputs

-   If show_plot is True then the plot of PDF and CDF will automatically be shown.
-   If print_results is True then the parameters of the most similar distributions will be printed.
-   results - an array of distributions objects ranked in order of best fit.
-   most_similar_distribution - a distribution object. This is the first item from results.

In the example below, we create a Normal Distribution object using the reliability.Distributions module. We then provide the Normal Distribution as input to simiar_distributions and the output reveals the top 3 most similar distributions. The optional input of include_location_shifted has been set to False.

.. code:: python

    from reliability.Distributions import Weibull_Distribution
    from reliability.Other_functions import similar_distributions
    dist = Weibull_Distribution(alpha=50,beta=3.3)
    similar_distributions(distribution=dist,include_location_shifted=False)

    '''
    The input distribution was:
    Weibull Distribution (α=50,β=3.3)

    The top 3 most similar distributions are:
    Normal Distribution (μ=44.942029160424156,σ=15.088282988835628)
    Gamma Distribution (α=6.208189340870667,β=7.2391525064583995)
    Lognormal Distribution (μ=3.734717404112832,σ=0.40754640953862314)
