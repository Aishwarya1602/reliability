Citing reliability in your work
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The following reference is using APA (6th edition):

**Reid, M. (2019). Reliability – a Python library for reliability engineering (Version 0.1.16) [Python].**

If you would like to use another referencing style, the details you may need are:

- **Author:** Matthew Reid
- **Year published:** 2019
- **Title:** Reliability – a Python library for reliability engineering
- **Version:** 0.1.16
- **Platform:** Python
- **Available from:** https://pypi.org/project/reliability/

Note that the version number is constantly changing so please check `pyPI <https://pypi.org/project/reliability/>`_ for the current version.

If you have used reliability in any published academic work, I would love to hear about it. Depending on the usage, I may provide a link to your work on the reliability documentation page. Please email me using the details on my GitHub profile if you've published any papers that cite reliability.
